Mount Kilimanjaro presents unique connectivity challenges. Combine satellite messengers with portable hotspots for the best results.

### Check Coverage Before You Climb

Lower camps often have cell service from major Tanzanian carriers. Above 3,000m, expect only intermittent signal.

### Bring Extra Power

Cold temperatures drain batteries quickly. Pack high-capacity power banks to keep devices running.
