Our 2025 speed tests reveal that Vodacom leads with average download speeds of 25 Mbps in major cities, while Airtel and Tigo follow closely behind.

| Network | Average Download |
|---------|-----------------|
| Vodacom | 25 Mbps |
| Airtel  | 22 Mbps |
| Tigo    | 20 Mbps |

Speeds drop significantly in rural areas, so consider a portable WiFi device that can switch between networks.
