Safari in Tanzania is unforgettable, but reliable internet can be tricky. Here are the top options to keep you online during your adventure.

## Portable WiFi Devices

Renting a portable WiFi hotspot lets you connect multiple devices and works across major parks. It\'s the easiest solution for groups.

## Local SIM Cards

Buying a local SIM is affordable if your phone is unlocked. Coverage varies by park, so check with your guide.

## Lodge WiFi

Many lodges offer WiFi in common areas, though speeds can be slow. Use it for quick messages rather than heavy uploads.
